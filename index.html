      <b>What is the CSS? </b>
    </div>
        <div class="supporting-info">
          <p>   CSS means Cascading Style Sheets and it's the code written
            to control the style of your HTML. With CSS we can actually apply rules to
            every element. <br> <br>
            Order in HTML matters. Styles can be defined in different places and are applied in the
              following order,with definitions further down the list overwriting previous definitions:<br> <br>
              a) the default style of a browser <br>
              b) stylesheet in a separate file which will be CSS ( this is what you will be mostly using)<br>
              c) stylesheet inside HTML <br>
              d) inline style in an element ( this can be done but it should be avoided)<br>
              <br> <br> Cascading means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also
              to all of those elements' child elements. However, if a child element has multiple overlapping rules defined for it,
              the more specific rule takes effect.</p>

        <div class="supporting-info">
          <p> In CSS you first write a selector , and this defines to which elements in the page

              <p>You can either select an HTML tags like p tag for example, and you can set
              a style which will apply to every p tag in your HTML document. To do this you have to write in your CSS code the following <br><br>
              p{ <br> .... <br>}

            Another way to apply a style is to select elements by class.A class refers to a group of elements that
            can be styled together. To define and to style a class in CSS you need to write the following.<br><br>
            .classname{<br>.......<br>}<br>
            Class selectors are your friend. They are probably the most usefull selectors out there. In part because they are well supported
            in all browsers. In part because you can add multiple classes just separated by a space on
            HTML elements .

            You can also use ID Selectors.IDs are unique identifiers that uniquely identifies and HTML Element.To define an ID Selector in CSS you need to write this :<br>
            #IDNAME{<br>.......<br>}<br>
            Note that the ID selectors are the most powerfull
            type of selector in terms of CSS specificity. Meaning that they beatout other
            type of selectors and the styles within win. It's better to have lower
            specificity selectors that are easier to overwrite when needed.

            <div class="idea-info">
             This method lets you stay more organised when working on larger projects.
              To do this :
              <br>
              <br>
              1) Write all of your structural HTML in one file ( lets say main.html).<br>
              2) In a separate file (lets call it main.css) put all of your CSS code.<br>
              3) Add a head element to the top of your html. <br>
              4) Add a link tag inside the head element. Since link is a void element you
              don't need to add a closing tag.<br>
              5) Add the following attributes to your link :<br>
              i)rel="stylesheet"<br>
              ii) href="main.css"<br><br>
             Between the body element you add only the HTML structure. Thus an example of an HTML code link to a CSS
             file follows in the picture bellow.<br>

           3) Write your CSS in the style element and put the HTML for the rest of the page below. <br>

             Because there are so many components to each box it can be really hard to define the size of the box just right. <br>
             By Default the size of your actual element is the sum of the border,padding and content width.
             There are two techniques you can use to help you deal with sizing issues:<br>
              <br>
              <b> 1) Set the box sizing attribute to border-box for every element.</b>
              In order to be able to set the actual size of your element from the beginning you need to write in your
              CSS code the following.
              <div class="image-container" >
              <img src="images/boxsizing.png" alt="image">

           <b> Box Positioning </b>
            <div class="idea-info">
             Divs are block elements so by default thay take up the entire width of the page.
             There are many things you can do in CSS to position boxes. And it's probably one of the most
             complicated things you can do in CSS. You can use Flexbox. Flexbox means flexible box and
             it provides an efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container or div.
             Adding the rule display:flex; to the aproppriate CSS will overwrite the behavior and lets DIVs (boxes) appear next
             to each other.<br><br>
             Thus in your CSS you need to write the following:<br>
             <br>
             .examplename{<br>
             display:flex;<br>
             }<br>
             <br>
             In the above example we grouped some elements under a class. The property we changed under this class
             is the display and we set this to the value flex. By doing so the boxes (that are grouped under this class) will be alligned next
             to each other in our website .

             How shall I know what to refine to look closer to my design mock up?

             1) Firstly you need to get the structure of the page right. You can do this by boxifying the design.<br>
             2) Then what's need to be a heading?<br>
             3) Think about the size of the boxes. <br>
             4) and the position of them on the screen <br>
             <br>
             In other words:
             <br>
             1) Look for natural boxes. <br>
             2) Look for repeated styles and design elements. <br>
             3) Write your HTML ( your structure) <br>
             4) Apply styles from biggest to smallest<br>
             5) Fix things <br>
             <br>
             Repeat points 3 and 4 until you are happy with the result. And remember Developer Tools can
             also help you!
